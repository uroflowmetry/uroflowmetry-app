## Urloflowmetry-app

[Functional overview of the app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SuvmlXOPugkAQJiNvBRmmNra03o4eOqbB7jLbiSqh0M/edit?usp=sharing) specifically designed to make a revolutionary, logistic free ICT4D (ICT for Development) technology to support preliminary diagnostic of Urological health issues (es: Prostatic Cancer, etc)

Free Software (AGPLv3) project developed by [Advanced Knowledge Ventures](http://www.akventures.eu) (Italy) in an international research medical cooperation with IT Laboratories in North Korea.

Here it's possible to download the [Project plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F5VELdtADGFrx5XEjiSiXiP60jQUQty5/view?usp=sharing) that is being developed for this implementation. (The detailed project plan has been produced after a couple of months of development).

To build the prototype, the budget that has been allocated for the open research and development is total of 7.100 EUR (4 months of work of a team of 6 persons).

Source code available for both client and server components:
* [Mobile Uroflowmetry app Github Repository](https://github.com/uroflowmetry/uroflowmetry-app) 
* [Server Uroflowmetry app Github Repository](https://github.com/uroflowmetry/uroflowmetry-server)

**WARNING**: This application is currently under active research and development - Do not use for any official medical purposes!

## Other Github Uroflowmetry project
Other open projects try to build an hardware uroflowmeters, while that's the first software one:
* [Uroflow](https://github.com/bgarberman/Uroflow)
* [DIY Uroflow](https://github.com/rokrodic/uroflow)

## Other Software Uroflowmetry research
Several other research has been done in leveraging Acoustic analysis for uroflowmetry, reasonable next step of evaluation of Uroflowmeter. Below the interesting research resources about Acoustic Analysis for uroflowmetry.
