[Functional overview of the app](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SuvmlXOPugkAQJiNvBRmmNra03o4eOqbB7jLbiSqh0M/edit?usp=sharing) specifically designed to make a revolutionary, logistic free ICT4D (ICT for Development) technology to support preliminary diagnostic of Urological health issues (es: Prostatic Cancer, etc)

Free Software (AGPLv3) project developed by [Advanced Knowledge Ventures](http://www.akventures.eu) (Italy) in an international research medical cooperation with IT Laboratories in North Korea.

**WARNING**: This application is currently under active research and development - Do not use for any official medical purposes!

This technical cooperation with North Korea's software developers is legally compliant with any regulatory restrictive measures applied by European Union as stated by [United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 2321 adopted on 30 November 2016](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/02/27/north-korea-sanctions/) as it related to **medical exchanges** :

* "to suspend scientific and technical cooperation involving persons or groups officially sponsored by or representing the DPRK **except for medical exchanges**"

Here it's possible to download the [Project plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F5VELdtADGFrx5XEjiSiXiP60jQUQty5/view?usp=sharing) that is being developed for this implementation.

To build the prototype, the budget that has been allocated for the open research and development is total of 7.100 (4 months of work of a team of 6 persons).
